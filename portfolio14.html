                Kanyakumari is on most travelers’ list for being the southernmost tip of India’s mainland. 
                About 86 km south east of Thiruvananthapuram, It is the point of confluence of the Arabian Sea,
                 the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. Kanyakumari is home to another unique geographical 
                 phenomenon that allows you to witness the sunrise and sunset at the same beach. The town gets its 
                 name from the Hindu goddess Kanyakumari, who has a temple dedicated to her here.
            </p></b></ul></li>
                
                  <ul><li><b><pclass="sansserif"> Various myths and legends have been associated with Kanyakumari.
                       One suggests that Kanya Devi was a reincarnation of Goddess Parvati was to marry Lord Shiva
                        but he failed to show up for the wedding. It is said that a demon king, Banasura could be 
                        killed only by a virgin girl. Kanya Devi had the power to do so. However, if she’d be married off,
                         she’d no longer be able to destroy the demon. Enraged, the goddess scattered all the food prepared for the wedding. 
                         It all eventually turned into stones. Some people believe that that the stones on shore that resemble
                          rice were actual grains of rice meant for the wedding feast.</li></b>

<li><p>“simply incredible.”</p></li>
<li><p>went there with my family and was amazed by the beauty and culture of the Kanyakumari.
     It is the southern-most part of India and is famous for its sunset point where you can see
      the sunset and moonrise simultaneously. There you can also see the 'Swami viveka nanda'
       rocks and many temples. It was a very refreshing experience.
