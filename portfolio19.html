                Kanchipuram, sometimes called Kanjeevaram or Kanchi, is a small town in Tamil Nadu. One of the most important
                 spiritual centres of Hinduism, and a major pilgrim destination; Kanchipuram has several medieval temples with
                  spectacular architecture. It used to be the capital of the Pallava kingdom from the 4th to the 10th century,
                   and was a centre of learning for all the major religions of South India. Hindu temples are still present and in use today,
                    and there are archaeological remains of Jain temples. Unfortunately, although Kanchipuram was reputed to be the centre of
                     Buddhism in South India, and was visited by Chinese Buddhist monks, there are no remains of the Buddhist presence today.

                       Kanchipuram (sometimes simply called Kanchi or Kanci) is an ancient city in the Tamil Nadu region of southern India.
                        Once a capital of the Pallava dynasty, Kanchipuram was also a noted centre of learning for Tamil and Sanskrit scholars.
                         Known as ‘the religious capital of the South’ its early 8th century CE Kailasanatha temple is one of the most impressive
                          structures surviving from ancient India.

  <li><p>Must visit city of 2500+ ancient temple.</p></li>
  <li><p>City of temple. There are more than 2500 small and big temples available in the city. 
      Best being kamakhi temple, ekambreswar temple, vaidiraj temple(Vishnu temple).
  Temple used to remain closed from 1 to 4 PM. Ekambraeswar temple is the one where goddess parvati did tapashya 
  for lord shiva under a mango tree, and the tree is still there. You can see big procession in Vishnu temple in evening time around 6 PM,
   where they bring 2500 year old shiva statue from his asana to outside of temple for worshiping, around 1000s of priests do the pooja
    at that time by chanting mantra in Sanskrit.

  <li><p>Hi friends this is my 2nd review in mouthshut.Hope this is going to help you all.
As the journey is very short and heritage rich, we( Myself and my wife) have decided to visit kanchipuram(kanchi)
    Kanchipuram is the place famous for two things
    1) temples
    2) Silk clothes(pattu)
    First thing to know before going there is, the temples in kanchipuram are
    open at 6am and are closed from 12pm to 4pm.So we need to plan our journey accordingly.
    otherwise its no use going there.Because we cannot enjoy the temples visit in the evening.

<li><p>Kanchipuram also known as Kanchi. The history of the city goes back into very long period.
     This is a city of temples with a population of less than one lac. Most of the population consists of Silk weavers and Astrologers.
     The city has lot of credits to it.
