                Kolli Hills in Tamil Nadu can be visited all round the year except for the month of January as the temperatures 
                drop down considering the altitude of this picturesque destination. In all the other months Kolli Hill weather
                 is quite pleasant. Hence, the best time to visit Kolli Hills is from February to December. Also, since there 
                 are limited number of attractions, an ideal duration of 2 to 3 days would be enough to explore the best of the Hills.

  <li><p>Kolli Hills located near Salem in Eastern ghats where nature crawling over the mountains. Legend Ramayanam mentioned 
      this as Madhuvanam which means Honey forest in the epic. Some other places located nearer such as Yercaud, Puliyan Solai etc. 
      Kolli Hills attracts one and all for its natural beauty.

<li><p>Kolli Hills,Salem..! </p></li>
<li><p>I must admit that this resort is built within the natural beauty of the Kolli Hills.Great Cabin accomodation with modern bathrooms,
     bed and a nice futon( sofa with bed) .The highlight of this place is its location, you will feel like you are camping in middle 
     of no where away from all the city madness and stress.Hospitality has been at its best with the help who work round the clock 
     serving home cooked food and serving almost what ever we ask for.Best place for trekking, off-roading and scenic points,
      exploration and most importantly relaxation.
