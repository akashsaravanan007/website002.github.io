                The ancient city of Madurai, more than 2,500 years old, was built by the Pandyan king, Kulashekarar,
                 in the 6th century B.C. But the reign of the Nayaks marks the golden period of Madurai when art, architecture and learning
                  flourished expansively. The most beautiful buildings in the city including its most famous landmark, the Meenakshi temple,
                   were built during the Nayak rule.Located in the heart of the city of Madurai, the Meenakshi-Sundareshwarar temple is 
                   dedicated to goddess Meenakshi, the consort of lord Shiva. It has long been the focus of both Indian and international
                    tourist attraction as well as one of the most important places of Hindu pilgrimage. For the people of Madurai, 
                    the temple is the very center of their cultural and religious life.It is said that the people of the city wake up, 
                    not by the call of nature but by the chant of hymns at the temple. All the major festivals of Tamil Nadu are celebrated here 
                    with gaiety, most important being the Chitrai festival that is held in April/May, when the celestial marriage of Meenakshi 
                    and Sundareshwarar is celebrated, drawing a huge crowd of people from all over the state.

                    Meenakshi was the daughter of King Malayadwaja Pandya and Queen Kanchanamala, who was born after performing several yagnas
                    (sacrificial rites). The three-year old girl emerged out of the fire during the final yagna. The princess Meenakshi, grew 
                    to be a beautiful young woman of great valour who conquered several lands and challenged the mightiest kings. It was then 
                    revealed that the princess was actually an incarnation of Parvati who came to earth to honour a promise given to Kanchanamala
                     in her previous life. Thus Shiva came to Madurai as Sundareshwarar to marry Meenakshi and the two ruled over the kingdom
                      for many years before they left for their heavenly abode from the spot where the temple now stands.
