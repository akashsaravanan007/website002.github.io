                Yercaud town got its name from the Yercaud Lake located at its center. In Tamil, Yeri means lake and Kaadu means forest. 
                 Stone-age implements have been found from the ancient shrine located near Shevaroy Hills, which is about 5 km from the Yercaud Lake.
                  Sir Thomas Munroe, erstwhile governor of Madras Presidency in 1842 developed this place. David Cockburn, the Scottish collector of Salem district,
                   between 1820 and 1829, was called the 'Father of Yercaud' because he helped in the development of the resources of the Shevaroy 
                   and for introducing the cultivation of coffee, pears and apple. Salem District was purchased by Mr. G.F. Fisher,
                    the only European Zamindar, in 1836. The Tea plantation has been introduced in 1840s by Dr.Wallich on the property of G.F.Fischer.

  <li><p>Hi guys I am sharing my experience of Yeracaud trip. I went yeracaud with my office team mates and I had 
      amazing experience. It is located on shevaroy ranges of the state of tamil nadu. Going yeracaud was the instant
       plan and we took 7-8 hours to reach yeracaud from bangalore. Weather in Yeracaud was too good we went in the month
        of october. We went to many places like children' s seat, gents seat , kiliyur falls, anna park and many more.

<li><p>Yercaud, nature at its best. </p></li>
<li><p>Yercaud one of the less explored hill stations in Tamilnadu is worth a visit because it is cheaper
     beautiful with its mist and greens. We stayed at SKT Residency (04281 - 291633).
     The accommodation was very cheap 825 rs. the rooms were neat and very spacious.the food esp
      tiffin items at this hotel is superb and very affordable...room numbers 201 to 204 are very nice carrying a valley view.
