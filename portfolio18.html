               <li><b> <pclass="sansserif">The name Hogenakal is derived from Kannada means ‘Smoky Rocks’.<br>
               
                Hogenakkal is a waterfall located in Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu where the Kaveri river splits 
                into multiple streams of waterfalls. Located at a distance of 180 km from Bangalore, Hogenakkal has 
                water throughout the year. The carbonite rocks, the coracle (basket boat) rides, freshwater fish,
                 oil massages by locals make it a perfect one day trip or a weekend getaway from Bangalore.
                 Sometimes referred to as the "Niagara Falls of India," it is also known for the medicinal baths. 
                 Also known at Marikottayam, Hoge actually means smoke and Kal means rock. 


                 </p></b></ul></li>
                
                  <ul><li><b><pclass="sansserif">  Recently, the place has been found to be littered with plastic bags and garbage 
                      and the fish market outside the waterfall might stink. Weekends can be crowded. Keep all these points in mind before visiting.
                      Hogenakkal is a small village on the Cauvery river in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu. It gets its name from the Kannada word, 
                      'Hoge' meaning ‘Smoke’ and 'kal' meaning ‘rocks’ and hence the term Hogenakkal meaning ‘Smoky Rocks’. A smoky appearance on the
                       rock is created by the water plummeting forcefully. This riverside village is located approximately 150 kilometers from the busy
                        metropolitan city, Bengaluru and is on the borders of the two states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

  <li><p>This place was suggested to me by one of my friend and is a perfect weekend getaway.
       It is about 180 kms from bangalore. We drove down to this place and the road is quite good.
        The round boat ride is must to try. They will take you inside from where the series of waterfalls would be visible
         and will get you dremched under them. Its really fun and for me it was first time in the round boat so I was super excited.
