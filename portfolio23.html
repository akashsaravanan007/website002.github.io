  <li><p>Mudhumalai - serene place to visit.</p></li>
  <li><p>Last year April, after spending our holiday in Ooty with our family we went to Mudumalai for our next adventure.
       Mudumalai is well connected by roads from Karnataka, Kerala and Tamilnadu. Let me tell you onething the route between ooty
        and mudumalai through kallatti was very risky, steep and the roads are not in good condition so please take utmost care possible.
         Another route from ooty to mudumalai is through gudalur the roads are quite good and safe through that way. But once we reached 
         Mudumalai we were delighted, the entire place gave us a fictional feel

  <li><p>Excellent trip to Mudumalai... .</p></li>
  <li><p> Our family had planned for a summer outing to go somewhere cool and far way from city life for 3 days.
       Our first choice was Ooty, however we dropped the plan to go to Ooty due to the rush in this peak season and instead decided
        to visit Mudumalai. We started from Bangalore on 6th May at 7AM in the morning and halted at Kamat for breakfast around 8:30AM. 
        By 10AM we were on the outskirts of Mysore and decided to visit the palace and brindavan gardens on our return journey.
        The road till Mysore was very good but the traffic was nothing less than the bangalore traffic.

<li><p>Greenwoods Nature Camp - Perfect Trip .</p></li>
<li><p>I am an expat from Belgium and visited Bangalore for a month. During one of the weekends decided to do a trip in the wild.
     Colleagues suggested Mudumalai or Bandipur for the trip. I did some research and found Green woods nature camp in the internet.
      ( http://www.greenwoodsnaturecamp.com).. Right from first call, I felt I was dealing with professional organizers. 
      The management in Greenwoods patiently provided me all the information and sent adequate details through email.
