  <li><p>Gopurams shadow is not seen - Brihadeeswar temple.</p></li>
  <li><p>Brihadeeswar temple is historical hindu temple. It clearly reflects the ancient Indian art and culture. 
      I have gone to this place before 3 years ago in a tamilnadu tour by bus.
       The temple was built by using granite. We can have a darshan of lord shiva inside the temple.
       Near to this temple there was a thanjavur fort which everyone should visit. The main amazing of temple is it has been constructed in such a way that its shadow does not fall on the ground.
