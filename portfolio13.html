                <ul>
               <li><b> <pclass="sansserif">Mahabalipuram or Mamallapuram is a historic city and UNESCO World Heritage site in Tamil Nadu, India.
                    During the reign of the Pallava dynasty, between the 3rd century CE and 7th century CE, it became an 
                    important centre of art, architecture and literature. Mahabalipuram was already a thriving sea port on 
                    the Bay of Bengal before this time. A significant amount of coins and other artefacts excavated from this 
                    region also indicate a pre-existing trade relation with the Romans even before it became a part of the Pallava Empire.</p></b></ul></li>
                
                  <ul><li><b><pclass="sansserif"> Mahabalipuram’s early history is completely shrouded in mystery. 
                      Ancient mariners considered this place the land of the Seven Pagodas. There are others who think that 
                      Mahabalipuram suffered from a great flood between 10,000 and 13,000 BCE. Controversial historian Graham
                       Hancock was one of the core members of a team of divers from Indian National Institute of Oceanography 
                       and the Scientific Exploration Society based in Dorset, UK who surveyed the ocean bed near Mahabalipuram 
                       in 2002 CE. He is more inclined to believe the flood theory. His exploration also afforded him a fair glimpse 
                       of the vast extent of submerged ruins of the city. After his underwater exploration, he reportedly commented, 
                       “I have argued for many years that the world’s flood myths deserve to be taken seriously, a view that most Western academics reject
                        … But here in Mahabalipuram, we have proved the myths right and the academics wrong.” 
                       Many opinions exist about the origin of the name of the site too. The most popular explanation is that the place
                        is named after benevolent King Bali, also known as Mahabali. The ancient Indian text of Vishnu Puran documents his exploits. 
                        After sacrificing himself to Vaman, an incarnation of Vishnu, he attained liberation. “Puram” is a Sanskrit term for a city 
                        or urban dwelling. Mamallapuram is the Prakrit version of the original Sanskrit name.</li></b>

<li><p>It's a wonderful small little tourist destination just 60 km from Chennai.
   The best part is that though it is world famous for its rock cut architecture, it is not commercialized enough to turn you off.</li>
