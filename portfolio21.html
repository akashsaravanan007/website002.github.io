                <ul>
               <li><b> <pclass="sansserif">Coonoor is the second largest hill station located in the Nilgiri hills.  <br>
               
                Coonoor is a hill station in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It’s known for its tea estates in the
                 surrounding Nilgiri hills. Sim’s Park is a sprawling public garden with plants like rhododendrons, roses and
                  eucalyptus trees. The steam Nilgiri Mountain Railway travels between the towns of Mettupalayam and Ooty via Coonoor.
                   Dolphin’s Nose is a vantage point with views of the cascading Catherine Falls.Coonoor is one of the three Nilgiri 
                   hill stations – Ooty, Kotagiri and Coonoor – that sit high above the southern plains. Smaller and quieter than Ooty
                    (20km northwest), it has some fantastic heritage hotels and guesthouses, from which you can do exactly the same things
                     (hike, visit tea plantations, marvel at mountain views) you would do from bigger, busier Ooty.




                 </p></b></ul></li>
                
                  <ul><li><b><pclass="sansserif"> 
                    From upper Coonoor, 
                    1km to 3km northeast (uphill) from the town centre, you can look down over a sea of red-tile rooftops to the slopes
                     beyond and soak up the cool climate, quiet environment and beautiful scenery. But you get none of the above in lower 
                     (central) Coonoor, which is a bustling, honking mess.Coonoor is located in the western part of the state of Tamilnadu, 
                     in the southern region of India, at the head of the Hulikal ravine at an altitude of 1850 m above sea level.
                      It is 19 km from Ooty. The weather in Coonoor is pleasant. Summers (April-June) are mild, while winters (November-February) are cool.
                       It experiences southwestern monsoon rains in July-September.

  <li><p>Coonoor, the beauty of mist and greens.</p></li>
  <li><p>The Nilgiri Mountain train that we boarded from Ooty, finally reached its destination. Going through the pristine valleys,
       eucalyptus plantations, bridge, tunnels and the beautiful scenery all around, we finally reached Coonoor, a quaint misty town in the Nilgiris.
       The station though small bursts with tourists whenever a train stops to embark or disembark passengers.The air was fresh though the sun was 
       still hidden behind the fog and mist.As soon we got out of the station we were surrounded by some sight seeing operators.
       We finally choose the one that promised us a half day sight seeing in a brand new Indica vista for 800 bucks.

<li><p>Coonoor - Indian Hill Station Gem-Superior to Ooty. </p></li>
<li><p>Coonoor gets a very passing mention about hill stations when compared to illustrious rivals like Ooty and Kodaikanal but boy 
    its a beautiful and silent place to spend time with your family.
    We went on July 10th and came back on July 14th from Bangalore thru KSTRC bus, the bus journey was a nightmare after Bandipore, 
    terrible roads, beware it would take 5 hours from Bandipur to goto Coonoor. Maybe a SUV can cover it in 4 hours? Another better
     way if one can afford it is fly from Bangalore to Coimbatore and then come via bus/taxi to Coonoor 
     (100 kms away, atleast 2-4 hours drive depending on the condition of the roads).
